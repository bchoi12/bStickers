# bStickers

Standalone Android keyboard with custom stickers & sticker packs from brianchoi.net

Coming soon (?): support for sending voice clips - this is actually mostly implemented, but there is virtually no support for inputting a random mp3 file from your keyboard to a messaging app (e.g. messenger, whatsapp)
